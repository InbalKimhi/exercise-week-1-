                    “Because you aren’t just someone I loved back then. You were my best friend, my best self, and I can’t imagine giving that up again.<br> You might not understand, but I gave you the best of me, and after you left,<br> nothing was ever the same.”

                        Lapland 
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    Lapland is the largest and northernmost region of Finland.<br> The 21 municipalities in the region cooperate in a Regional Council. Lapland borders the region of North Ostrobothnia in the south. It also borders the Gulf of Bothnia, Norrbotten County in Sweden, Troms and Finnmark County in Norway, and Murmansk Oblast and the Republic of Karelia in Russia.<br> Topography varies from vast mires and forests of the South to fells in the North.<br> The Arctic circle crosses Lapland, so polar phenomena such as the midnight sun and polar night can be seen in Lapland.

                    Snowfall and safety. <br> Unbroken wilderness and environmental responsibility.<br> Lapland in winter is like nowhere else on Earth. <br> The boundless nature and experiences exclusive to the Arctic like the Northern Lights I personally got to see or just the fun of snowballs, reindeer and Santa Claus's villge. <br> I got to celebrate my 13th birthday there and its definetly a trip to remember!
